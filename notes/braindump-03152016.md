# A bunch of notes trying to figure out what the hell this is

## Ok so what the hell is this

So Martha made this diagram that, for her, basically explains why everything about credit scoring and the financial system is not only wrong, but fundamentally misunderstood. Which is to say, she made a diagram of the system itself, over time, and the factors that shaped it and brought us to wherever we are today. 

The thing is, right now the diagram doesn't really work without Martha explaining it to you. This is partly because none of us are as smart as her, I think, but also because it has a bunch of complex background information about the history of finance that she happens to be an expert on. 

There are a few key concepts that it seems like the diagram (or really, Martha explaining it) tries to get across, which kind of could be taken independently or as a series of points:

### The public conception of consumer creditworthiness (and, to some extent, business creditworthiness) is implictly assumed to be a measure of character.

This goes back to like, decades, back to the Mercantile Agency of 1841 and the massive folios that would become the little books published by Moody's and Fitch. And it persisted--this is J.P. Morgan testifying for the Pujo Commission in 1912: "The first thing [in credit] is character...before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it...A man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom. I think that is the fundamental basis of business."

### In a globalized financial system, credit scores don't act so much as indicators of individual worthiness for a loan as a kind of transmission protocol for the movement of capital. 

This is maybe not the most coherent way to describe it, I'm working on it. But roughly: given that the loans (good terms or not) are destined in a global financial landscape to end up in a securitized asset, credit scores could be understood as more of a way to move around money and, for those who define the credit scores and/or issue the loans, make money. (something something the fact SoFi started a fucking hedge fund)

This is an argument made mainly to undermine the question of whether the algorithms of credit scoring (the black boxes primarily in question) are fair, or could be fair. If we could see them, the logic goes, if we understood their proprietary inner workings, we would know if they were biased or not. 

But at its heart the credit system (I can't speak for the humans in said system) doesn't really care about fairness (beyond, maybe, a public relations or media campaign angle). The calculation of risk and the calculation of creditworthiness is still, at the end of the day, a mere calculation, one necessary to move money through a globalized pipeline. Power doesn't really lie in the algorithm itself or its so-called fairness; it lies in the ability to move money around with that algorithm. It lies in who owns the algorithm. (This is not a revolutionary idea but it is one that is hard to keep track of in the layers of abstraction inherent to talking about finance.)

### Seeking a "fair" credit system necessarily means seeking a radically different financial system altogether.

Right now, both the old finance version of credit and the startup-alt version of credit are broken. One has a semblance of regulation maintaining it, the other is going to work like crazy to avoid any regulation. At the level of the individual getting a loan, maybe one option will work out better than the other. But implemented a large-scale level that constructs things like mortgage-backed securities, eventually that system kind of fucks everyone except the institutions that create and hold the financial instruments.

This is maybe where Facebook credit score dystopia comes in. This is where we start talking about how this isn't just an American narrative and talk about how China's experimenting with basically bringing *My Super Sad Love Story* to life. I don't know what a "fair" lending system in which people aren't readily screwed over looks like, but I'm pretty sure that the systems we have and the systems being proposed aren't particularly designed to redistribute wealth so much as recirculate it. 

(Here, Martha and I may disagree. I am not sure.)

## OK so why is there a Twine game in the repo right now

*Disclaimer that I do Not Make Games, I am not a Games Person please don't make me Talk About Games Or Approach The Toxic Garbage Fire That As Far As I Can Tell Constitutes Games.*

Ahem.

There's a Twine game because to some extent, this original diagram Martha made is a narrative, but it's not a linear one. The point at which one starts in the diagram kind of depends on the question you're trying to ask. Martha, because she's Martha, will probably tell you that your question (whatever it is) is the wrong question. And she's probably right, but we have to start somewhere. In some ways the point is to take people through the material and help viewers understand why that initial question is beside the point.

Revising the diagram as a Twine game seemed like a useful way to first, prompt Martha to develop copy and language necessary to break these concepts down (because right now they live in her head, Sean Connery in *The Rock* style) and second, as a way to actually play out what those different narrative threads could look like.

## So is it going to be a big dumb interactive or what

The temptation to go the path of an [inequality.is](http://inequality.is) is strong--make some eye candy, get lots of clicks and RTs, dopamine rush, demonstrate in a non-NDA project that I actually do kind of know how to write code you guise, etc. 

But I have anxieties about how long anyone actually ever *stays* on those interactives and how much they actually retain. Like no disrespect to the inequality.is team but my primary takeaway from that project was "man, y'all did a lot of work."

Also there's a tempatation in that scenario to make it an actual game where people just always lose--

There's something really, really compelling to me about making actual black boxes--oblique devices that actually do something. Like I'm kind of obsessed with this weird [Pi/Arduino punch card reader](https://github.com/whaleygeek/punchcard_reader) and basically anything that uses thermal printers (insert jokes about the [Paperwork Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IZw2CoYztk) here). 

Something like a contingent kinetic sculpture, maybe--a collection of components that, when connected to the black box, lead to different outputs (or, if we're talking about the protocol concept, the same output with slight variations? IDK IDK). 

In some ways the Twine thing is also a prompt to fill in those blanks--what would this passage look like as a physical object? What would it do? What kind of effect would it have when connected to this other passage? Lights? Sound? Fire? (I really just want to do a thing with fire.) Finance as a Rube Goldberg machine, but with slightly less transparency. 

And this could still live online? I like the idea of using something like the Twine framing to lead people through videos of a kinetic thing. But I don't know exactly what all the parts are yet, so.
